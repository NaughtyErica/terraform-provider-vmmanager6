### Optional

- `pm_api_token` (String) API Token
- `pm_dangerously_ignore_unknown_attributes` (Boolean) By default this provider will exit if an unknown attribute is found. This is to prevent the accidential destruction of VMs or Data when something in the VMmanager 6 API has changed/updated and is not confirmed to work with this provider.

- `pm_tls_insecure` (Boolean) By default, every TLS connection is verified to be secure. This option allows terraform to proceed and operate on servers considered insecure. For example if you're connecting to a remote host and you do not have the CA cert that issued the VMmanager 6 api url's certificate.
